      <h2>What's our rate?</h2>
      <p>
        Our day rate for web work is <strong>$400/day</strong> and we offer half-day increments for smaller requests.
      </p>

      <h2>How long will your project take?</h2>
      <p>
        Well&hellip;that almost always is entirely <strong>up to you</strong>! Every project is unique and has different requirements and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, we simplify our quotes into line-itemized day-based quotes by feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives both parties a great understanding of the rough timeline a feature/website will take,
        and if those requirements or that feature changes, that's totally fine! We will just provide an
        updated day count to implement those changes for you.
      </p>

      <h2>But seriously, can you give me a ballpark?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely! Here's a non-binding list of rough estimates for the types of websites we build on the regular.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CMS Build: <strong>20 days</strong></li>
        <li>Static Website: <strong>10 days</strong></li>
        <li>Design + CMS Build: <strong>30 days</strong></li>
        <li>Design + CMS Build + Custom Search Integration: <strong>35 days</strong></li>
      </ul>
